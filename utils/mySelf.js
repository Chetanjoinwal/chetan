  Hello! My name is Chetan Kumar, I love designing and developing interactive user experiences for the web. From a young age, I was curious about how websites worked — I spent hours exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through browser inspect tools, tweaking colors, styles, and functionality. That early curiosity turned into a strong passion, and eventually, I decided to turn it into a career.`,
  `
  For me, front-end development is a creative way to bring ideas to life and explore the limitless world of modern web technologies.`,
  `
  Besides coding, I enjoy exploring UI/UX design trends, building smooth user interfaces, and keeping up with the latest in tech. I also have a strong interest in animation and motion design on the web.`,
  `
  Over time, I've delivered successful projects to a variety of clients — from individual startups to professional organizations — gaining experience collaborating with people from different backgrounds, both locally and internationally.`,

  `
  Over time, I've worked with various front-end technologies and frameworks including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, and more...
